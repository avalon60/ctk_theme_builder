# Menus
As you have undoubtedly noticed, when you launch CTk Theme Builder, the control panel has menu a menu toolbar. This includes a *File* menu as well as a Tools menu, as we see here:

![Main Menu](main-menus.png) 

Note that these are presented differently on MacOS.

The options of the File menu, bear a close correspondence to the buttons displayed on the control panel, whereas the Tools options are only available via the menu toolbar.

### The File Menu

![File Menu](file-menu.png) 

When you first start CTk Theme Builder, if you don't have a theme selected, you will find that most of the *File* menu options are disabled. They only become enabled when you start working on a theme.

The options on the *File* menu, have corresponding buttons in the left hand region of the control panel. Please refer to the section on the Control Panel to read about their function.

### Tools Menu
The *Tools* menu provides access to:

1. User Preferences
2. Colour Harmonics dialogue
3. About (CTk Theme Builder)

The Colour Harmonics option is only enabled, when you start working on a theme.

Each of these are covered in their own dedicated section.
